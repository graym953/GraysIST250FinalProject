        <h1>Come get great sneakers for a great price!</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>How these sneakers will be better than the ones on your feet</h2>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"> I have been collecting shoes for about <b>10 years</b>, and they have been treated better than anyone else could. They consist of Jordans, Yeezys, and Vans. Even though they're used, I am listing them at a price you will not find <em>anywhere else.</em></p>
        <h2>What will I be doing with the profits?</h2>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"> I am selling these shoes to help pay for my <b>outstanding</b> tuition bill. If you purchase one of my pairs of shoes—which you absolutely should—you're supporting me in getting a higher education which means the world to me.  </p>

     <h2>Why My Collection is Unique</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>I have cleaned and stored each pair in pristine conditions.</li>
        <li>Some are limited-edition releases which are hard to find.</li>
        <li>All different types of styles so you'll have to like atleast one pair. </li>
     </ul>
